<p style="color:white; font-family:Montserrat; font-size:150%; text-align:center;"> Welcome to Campus First!<br>
Congratulations on making it to the first batch of Campus First Teams at DSU! <br>
Y'all will be the Future Reps for our college at any event that takes place within our college or at any other college that is hosted/organized by Viral Fission.<br>
The gratifications for the winners of the events are quite MASSIVE. So give it your 110% and make sure that you are the best!!<br>
The winners of the events stand to win cash prizes, and if you are good enough, you may even have a chance of landing a brand collab with some of your favorite brands that are associated with your chosen field of interest.<br>
<br>
We will be following the below roadmap for the remainder of the Campus First journey at DSU <br></p>
