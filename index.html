<h1><center> Welcome to Campus First! </center></h3>
You all will be the Future Reps for our college
at any future event that takes place within our college or at any other college event that is hosted/organized by Viral Fission.
The gratifications for the winners of the events are quite MASSIVE.
The winners stand to win cash prizes, and if you are good enough, you may even have a chance of landing a brand collab with your favorite brand that is associated with your chosen field of interest.

We will be following the below roadmap for the remainder of the Campus First journey at DSU
