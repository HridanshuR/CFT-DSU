<p style="color:white; font-family:Calibri; font-size:150%; text-align:center;"><br>
Congratulations on making it to the first batch of Campus First Teams at DSU! <br>
Y'all will be the Future Reps for our college at any event that takes place within our college or at any other college that is hosted/organized by Viral Fission.<br>
The gratifications for the winners of the events are quite MASSIVE. So give it your 110% and make sure that you are the best!!<br>
The winners of the events stand to win cash prizes, and if you are good enough, you may even have a chance of landing a brand collab with some of your favorite brands that are associated with your chosen field of interest.<br>
  <br></p>
  <p style="color:red; font-family:Calibri; font-size:175%; text-align:center;"><br>
    Please note that we will be selecting only a few people out of the total 250+ people that have registered. <br>
    Unfortunately there is a ceiling to the number of people that I can include on my Campus Crew.<br>
    However if we feel that you are deserving of a spot on the crew despite reaching the ceiling, I'll find a way to get you a spot! </p>
<p style="color:white; font-family:Calibri; font-size:150%; text-align:center;"><br>
  We will be following the below roadmap for the Campus First journey at DSU<br></p>
