The gratifications for the winners of the events are quite MASSIVE. So give it your 110% and make sure that you are the best!!<br>
The winners of the events stand to win cash prizes, and if you are good enough, you may even have a chance of landing a brand collab with your favorite brand that is associated with your chosen field of interest.<br>
<br>
We will be following the below roadmap for the remainder of the Campus First journey at DSU <br></p>
